Module "lin1"      (component lin)
   - lin1_LIN_DRV_Init -Initializes an instance LIN Hardware Interface for LIN Network.

   - lin1_LIN_DRV_InstallCallback -Installs callback function that is used for LIN_DRV_IRQHandler.
   - lin1_LIN_DRV_SendFrameDataBlocking -Sends Frame data out through the LIN Hardware Interface using blocking method. This 
                function will calculate the checksum byte and send it with the frame data. Blocking means that the function 
                does not return until the transmission is complete. This function checks if txSize is in range from 1 to 8. If 
                not, it will return STATUS_ERROR. This function also returns STATUS_ERROR if node's current state is in SLEEP 
                mode. This function checks if the isBusBusy is false, if not it will return LIN_BUS_BUSY. The function does not 
                return until the transmission is complete. If the transmission is successful, it will return STATUS_SUCCESS. If 
                not, it will return STATUS_TIMEOUT.
   - lin1_LIN_DRV_SendFrameData -Sends frame data out through the LIN Hardware Interface using non-blocking method. This 
                enables an a-sync method for transmitting data. Non-blocking  means that the function returns immediately. The 
                application has to get the transmit status to know when the transmit is complete. This function will calculate 
                the checksum byte and send it with the frame data. The function will return immediately after calling this 
                function. If txSize is equal to 0 or greater than 8 or node's current state is in SLEEP mode then the function 
                will return STATUS_ERROR. If isBusBusy is currently true then the function will return LIN_BUS_BUSY. Note: if 
                users use LIN_DRV_TimeoutService in a timer interrupt handler, then before using this function, users have to 
                set timeout counter to an appropriate value by using LIN_DRV_SetTimeoutCounter(instance, timeoutValue). The 
                timeout value should be big enough to complete the transmission. Timeout in real time is (timeoutValue) * (time 
                period that LIN_DRV_TimeoutService is called). For example, if LIN_DRV_TimeoutService is called in an timer 
                interrupt with period of 500 micro seconds, then timeout in real time is timeoutValue * 500 micro seconds.
   - lin1_LIN_DRV_GetTransmitStatus -Get status of an on-going non-blocking transmission. While sending frame data using 
                non-blocking method, users can use this function to get status of that transmission. The bytesRemaining shows 
                number of bytes that still needed to transmit.
   - lin1_LIN_DRV_AbortTransferData -Aborts an on-going non-blocking transmission/reception. While performing a non-blocking 
                transferring data, users can call this function to terminate immediately the transferring.
   - lin1_LIN_DRV_ReceiveFrameDataBlocking -Receives frame data through the LIN Hardware Interface using blocking method. This 
                function receives data from LPUART module using blocking method, the function does not return until the receive 
                is complete. The interrupt handler LIN_LPUART_DRV_IRQHandler will check the checksum byte. If the checksum is 
                correct, it will receive the frame data. If the checksum is incorrect, this function will return STATUS_TIMEOUT 
                and data in rxBuff might be wrong. This function also check if rxSize is in range from 1 to 8. If not, it will 
                return STATUS_ERROR. This function also returns STATUS_ERROR if node's current state is in SLEEP mode. This 
                function checks if the isBusBusy is false, if not it will return LIN_BUS_BUSY.
   - lin1_LIN_DRV_ReceiveFrameData -Receives frame data through the LIN Hardware Interface using non-blocking method. This 
                function will check the checksum byte. If the checksum is correct, it will receive it with the frame data. 
                Non-blocking  means that the function returns immediately. The application has to get the receive status to 
                know when the reception is complete. The interrupt handler LIN_LPUART_DRV_IRQHandler will check the checksum 
                byte. If the checksum is correct, it will receive the frame data. If the checksum is incorrect, this function 
                will return STATUS_TIMEOUT and data in rxBuff might be wrong. This function also check if rxSize is in range 
                from 1 to 8. If not, it will return STATUS_ERROR. This function also returns STATUS_ERROR if node's current 
                state is in SLEEP mode. This function checks if the isBusBusy is false, if not it will return LIN_BUS_BUSY. 
                Note: if users use LIN_DRV_TimeoutService in a timer interrupt handler, then before using this function, users 
                have to set timeout counter to an appropriate value by using LIN_DRV_SetTimeoutCounter(instance, timeoutValue). 
                The timeout value should be big enough to complete the reception. Timeout in real time is (timeoutValue) * 
                (time period that LIN_DRV_TimeoutService is called). For example, if LIN_DRV_TimeoutService is called in an 
                timer interrupt with period of 500 micro seconds, then timeout in real time is timeoutValue * 500 micro seconds.
   - lin1_LIN_DRV_GetReceiveStatus -Get status of an on-going non-blocking reception. This function returns whether the data 
                reception is complete. When performing non-blocking transmit, the user can call this function to ascertain the 
                state of the current receive progress: in progress (STATUS_BUSY) or timeout (STATUS_TIMEOUT) or complete 
                (STATUS_SUCCESS). In addition, if the reception is still in progress, the user can obtain the number of bytes 
                that still needed to receive.

   - lin1_LIN_DRV_GetCurrentNodeState -Get the current LIN node state.

                LIN_DRV_TimeoutService to check if timeout has occurred during non-blocking frame data transmission and 
                reception. User may initialize a timer (for example FTM) in Output Compare Mode with period of 500 micro 
                seconds (recommended). In timer IRQ handler, call this function.
   - lin1_LIN_DRV_SetTimeoutCounter -Set Value for Timeout Counter that is used in LIN_DRV_TimeoutService.
   - lin1_LIN_DRV_MasterSendHeader -Sends frame header out through the LIN Hardware Interface using a non-blocking method. This 
                function sends LIN Break field, sync field then the ID with correct parity. This function checks if the 
                interface is Master, if not, it will return STATUS_ERROR.This function checks if id is in range from 0 to 0x3F, 
                if not it will return STATUS_ERROR.

                parity bits are correct or 0xFF if parity bits are incorrect. If action is making parity bits, then from input 
                value of ID, the function returns PID. This is not a public API as it is called by other API functions
   - lin1_LIN_DRV_MakeChecksumByte -Makes the checksum byte for a frame
